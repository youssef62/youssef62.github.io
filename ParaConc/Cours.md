# Parallelism and Concurrency 

**Parallelism** : In parallel computing, execution occurs at the same physical instant: for example, on separate processors of a multi-processor machine, with the goal of speeding up computations. 

**Concurrency : ** concurrent computing consists of process *lifetimes* overlapping, but execution need not happen at the same instant.( process 1 then process 2 then process 1 again ... )
